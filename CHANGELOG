### Release 1.0

* PpyMilter 1.0 message modification handling has changed and is NOT backwards
  compatible with any previous PpyMilter release:
  ppymilterbase.PpyMilter no longer stores internal state when clients
  call message modification functions (e.g. ChangeHeader, AddRecipient, etc)
  to store up and send at the proper phase in the milter protocol.  Instead
  clients must store this state themselves, register an OnEndBody() function
  and then "return self.ReturnOnEndBodyActions(modification_list)" to
  send all modifications to a message.  See the the ppymilter wiki or the 
  docstring for ppymilterbase.PpyMilter.ReturnOnEndBodyActions() for more 
  info and an example.
